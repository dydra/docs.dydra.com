SPARQL
======

SPARQL is the standard query language for RDF.  Like SQL for relational
databases, the [varying
implementations](http://esw.w3.org/SparqlImplementations) often differ
slightly, or have a few extensions, but the basics are the same.

### SPARQL and Dydra

Dydra implements SPARQL.  Every Dydra repository has a standard SPARQL endpoint
at `/your/repository/sparql`.

Dydra's SPARQL dialect is well-defined by an executable specification, which
will be released soon.
