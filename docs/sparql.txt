SPARQL
======

SPARQL is the standard query language for RDF.  Like SQL for relational
databases, the [varying
implementations](http://esw.w3.org/SparqlImplementations) often differ
slightly, or have a few extensions, but the basics are the same.

### SPARQL Overview

Here's a very [thorough overview of SPARQL.](http://www.cambridgesemantics.com/2008/09/sparql-by-example/)

### SPARQL and Dydra

Every Dydra repository has a standard SPARQL endpoint at
`/your/repository/sparql`. We have [more information](/dydra-sparql) about our SPARQL dialect and supported features.
