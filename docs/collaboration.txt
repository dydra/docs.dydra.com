Repository Collaboration
========================

Dydra allows you to add multiple collaborators to your repository. Collaborators
can be given read and/or write access to each of your repositories.

A collaborator with read access will be able to view the contents of the 
repository and any saved queries that exist for that repository.

Collaborators with write access to a repository will be able to manipulate
the data in the repository as well as any saved queries contained within
the repository.

A collaborator with write access cannot delete a repository or modify the
metadata of the repository. These operations are still restricted
to the repository owner.

Please note that collaborator permissions take precendence over repository
level privacy settings. This means that collaborators can view
repositories that you mark as "private" or otherwise restrict using the
permissions setting on the privacy tab of the repository edit page.

To manage your repository's collaborators, click on the "Edit" link in the
"Admin" dropdown located on the main repository page. The edit page will contain a
"Collaborators" tab that will list all collaborators for that repository. You can add
a collaborator by entering in an account name or the email address
of an existing account into the form at the bottom of the list. At a minimum, you
must specify at least read-level access.

Once a collaborator has been added to a repository, you can update their 
permissions by clicking on the pertinent "read" or "write" permissions 
checkboxes located next to that account.

Permission updates are instantaneous. Once you have added, removed, or updated a 
collaborator they will be able to begin accessing the repository immediately.
