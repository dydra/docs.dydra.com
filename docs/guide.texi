@node About this Document
@chapter About this Document

This is the developer guide for Dydra. It provides a conceptual overview of
Dydra, programming reference material, and a detailed API reference.

@node Introduction to Dydra
@chapter Introduction to Dydra

This chapter provides you with a high-level overview of the Dydra web
service, to give you a good idea of what it offers, how it works, and how
you can utilize it in your business.

@node Understanding Dydra
@chapter Understanding Dydra

This chapter delves deeper into a number of key concepts that you should
have an understanding of before moving on to subsequent chapters.

@node Developing with Dydra
@chapter Developing with Dydra

This chapter explains how to use Dydra to store data for your application.
It shows you how to execute API operations, how to authenticate those
operations using your Dydra account credentials, and more concretely how
to work with and query repositories.

@section Querying Repositories
@include guide/develop/query-tuning.texi

@node API Reference
@chapter API Reference
@cindex API, reference

This chapter contains detailed descriptions of all Dydra API operations,
their request parameters, and their responses and error conditions. It also
contains concrete on-the-wire examples of requests and responses for each
operation.

@section Operations

This section describes the RPC methods supported by the Dydra API.

@sp 1
@quotation Note
The example requests and responses in this section are shown using the
JSON-RPC protocol over HTTP as the transport. The API endpoint supports
both the XML-RPC and JSON-RPC protocols, with the latter being strongly
preferred due to its relative efficiency, simplicity, and brevity.
