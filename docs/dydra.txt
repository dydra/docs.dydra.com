What is Dydra?
=========================

Dydra is a cloud-based RDF store, a database-as-a-service. Just import your
data and a SPARQL endpoint will be available for your application to use. 

### Multi-Tenant

Dydra is a multi-tenant data store and query engine. You don't need to
estimate your data size, worry about clusters, nodes, or resource use, and
you'll always be running the latest version of the platform.

### Fully Managed

We manage every piece of the data store, including versioning, disaster
recovery, performance, and more. You just use it.

### No Lock-in

Dydra uses open standards recommended by the W3C. You can use Dydra from any
programming language running on any platform on any device. All you need is an
internet connection. And you own your data: it's always yours to take with you
in the easiest, smoothest way possible.

### Easy
