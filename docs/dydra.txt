Dydra is a cloud-based graph database. Whether you're using existing social
network APIs or want to build your own, Dydra treats your customers' social
graph as exactly that.


With Dydra, your data is natively stored as a **property graph,** directly
representing the relationships in the underlying data.

### Expressive

With Dydra, you access and update your data via an industry-standard query
language specifically designed for graph processing, SPARQL. It's easy to use
and we provide a handy in-browser query editor to help you learn.

<pre ><code>
# find all of bob's friends of friends
SELECT ?friend, ?friend_of_friend WHERE {
  :bob :has_friend ?friend .
  :friend :has_friend ?friend_of_friend .
}
</code></pre>

### Fast

Dydra is built from the ground up to be performant for use cases built on
graphs, like social networking. The performance benefits are impressive.

### Flexible

You can use Dydra for lots of use cases, not just social networking. Lots of
problems translate well to graphs; we have customers exploring everything from
movie relationships to transaction logs.


### The Cloud

In addition to a powerful new addition to your toolbox, Dydra comes with the
benefits of a cloud service you've come to love:

#### Transparent Scaling

Dydra is a multi-tenant data store and query engine. You don't need to
estimate your data size, worry about clusters, nodes, resource use, or make big
licensing commitments up front. And you'll always be running the latest version
of the platform.

#### Fully Managed

We manage every piece of the data store, including versioning, disaster
recovery, performance, and more. You just use it.

#### No Lock-in

Dydra uses open standards recommended by the W3C. You can use Dydra from any
programming language running on any platform on any device. All you need is an
internet connection. And you own your data: it's always yours to take with you
in a number of formats.
