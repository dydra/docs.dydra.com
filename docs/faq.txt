During our beta period, we enforce various soft and hard resource limits to
help with our capacity planning:

* As a baseline, we currently rate limit beta users to 5 queries per second.
  If you need a higher burst rate, please contact support@dydra.com.
* We ask that you keep repository sizes at or below 1 million statements.
  Again, if you need a higher limit, please contact us.

-------------------------------------------------------------

We aim to provide continuous service, save for a brief weekly scheduled
maintenance window on Fridays at 23:00 UTC when 5-15 minutes of downtime can
be expected.

There may be occasional brief unscheduled downtime now and then to address
more urgent matters or to deploy additional capacity. Follow
