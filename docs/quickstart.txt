Dydra Quickstart Guide
=======================

After you [create your account](dydra.com/signup), visit your dashboard and
create a new repository.

Go to your repository's page. Use the link on the upper right to import data.
You can import from local files, copy/paste, or simply
input a URL that we'll fetch for you.

Create a [SPARQL](/sparql) query on your repository.  Try this one to get a list of the
predicates in your dataset:

    SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }

Go ahead.  Run it.  You'll see a the results in your browser.

### SPARQL

Your repository already has a standard SPARQL endpoint.  It's at:

<pre>http://dydra.com/<i>your</i>/<i>repository</i>/sparql</pre>

### API

In addition to a standard SPARQL endpoint, we provide our own asynchronous API
for processing standard SPARQL queries, which we'll be documenting soon.
