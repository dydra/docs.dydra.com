Dydra Quickstart Guide
=======================

After [creating your account,](dydra.com/signup) visit your dashboard and
create a new repository.

Go to your repository's page, where you'll be able to import data (see the link
on the upper right).  You can import from local files, copy/paste, or simply
input a URL that we'll fetch for you.

Create a [SPARQL](/sparql)query on your repository.  Try this one to get a list of the
predicates in your dataset:

    SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }

Go ahead and run it.  You'll see a list in your browser.

### SPARQL

Your repository already has a standard SPARQL endpoint.  It's at:

    http://dydra.com/your/repository/sparql

### API

In addition to a standard SPARQL endpoint, we provide our own asynchronous API
for processing standard SPARQL queries, which we'll be documenting soon.
