Quickstart Guide
================

Dydra is an RDF store meant to be quick and easy for developers. Getting
started quickly will require already being familiar with [RDF](/rdf) and
[SPARQL](/sparql).

You can get started quickly using either the web interface or the command-line
RubyGem. As soon as you've created your repository, your SPARQL endpoint is
already ready.

## Starting from your browser

After you [create your account](http://dydra.com/signup), visit your dashboard and
create a new repository with the `New` button. You can enter some optional
metadata; the only thing your repository needs is a name.

After creating your repository, you should be at your repository's home page.
Use the link on the upper right to import data.  You can import from local
files, copy/paste, or simply input a URL that we'll fetch for you. During the
beta period, there are some limitations on the size of repositories we'll allow
you to create.

After your import is complete, try running a quick query. Click 'Query' on the
upper right, and you'll visit the query creation screen, which lets you run
example [SPARQL](/sparql) queries in your browser.  Try this one to get a list
of the predicates in your dataset:

    SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }

Go ahead and run it.  You'll see a the results in your browser.

When you're done, you can access your [SPARQL endpoint](/api/sparql) via any
existing tools you might have.

## Command line RubyGem

You can perform most repository functions from the command line with the
`dydra` RubyGem. After creating your account, try this:

    $ gem install dydra
    $ dydra create my-test-repository
    Username or Email address: <your username>
    Password: 
    $ dydra import my-test-repository http://datagraph.org/jhacker.nt
    $ dydra query my-test-repository 'SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE {?s ?p ?o}'

When you're done, you can access your [SPARQL endpint](/api/sparql) via any
existing tools you might have.

## SPARQL

Your repository already has a standard SPARQL endpoint.  It's at:

<pre>http://dydra.com/<i>your</i>/<i>repository</i>/sparql</pre>
