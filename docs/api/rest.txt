REST API
========

You can perform most account functions on Dydra.com via a standard [REST
API.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)

### API Token

You'll want your API token for most REST API operations. Your API token is very
much like your password, except that it does not provide permissions to edit
your password. You can use it most anywhere you can use your password. You can
find your API token either on your account dashboard in your browser, or if you
perform an authenticated request with your username and password for your
account information via the REST API.

### Supported Formats

The dydra.com REST API supports `application/json` (for JSON requests) and
`application/xml` (for XML requests) formats for both input and output. Simply
set your client's 'Accept:' headers to the appropriate format.

#### Your Account

You can read and update your account information by  accessing your account URL
at `http://dydra.com/<your account>`. If you perform HTTP basic authentication,
you can retrive your API token here.

#### Your Repositories

##### Creating

You can create a repository by performing an authenticated POST request to
`http://dydra.com/<your account>/repositories`. You only need to include the
repository name.

##### Managing

You'll download your repository in various RDF formats from your repository's
URL, so your repositories' REST APIs are at `http://dydra.com/<your
account>/<repository>/meta`.
