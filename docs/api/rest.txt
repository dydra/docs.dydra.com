REST API
========

You can perform most account functions on Dydra.com via a standard [REST
API.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)

### Authentication

Please see the [API Authentication](/api/authentication) documentation
for a reference on authenticating to Dydra's REST API.

### Supported Formats

The dydra.com REST API supports `application/json` (for JSON requests) and
`application/xml` (for XML requests) formats for both input and output. Simply
set your client's 'Accept:' headers to the appropriate format.

#### Your Account

You can read and update your account information by  accessing your account URL
at `http://dydra.com/<your account>`. If you perform HTTP basic authentication,
you can retrive your API token here.

#### Your Repositories

##### Creating

You can create a repository by performing an authenticated POST request to
`http://dydra.com/<your account>/repositories`. You only need to include the
repository name.

##### Managing

You'll download your repository in various RDF formats from your repository's
URL, so your repositories' REST APIs are at `http://dydra.com/<your
account>/<repository>/meta`.
