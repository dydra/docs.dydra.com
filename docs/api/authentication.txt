API Authentication
==================

Authentication to Dydra's API can be accomplished several ways. We recommend using one
of the API authentication key methods below.

## Your API Authentication Key

You API Authentication Key can be found by clicking on the `Your API Key` button in the upper
right hand corner of you account page. This button will show you your current authentication
key and allow you to regenerate a new key should your current key become compromised.

## HTTP Authentication With an API Authentication Key

The recommended authentication mechanism is using standard HTTP authentication in conjunction with
your Dydra API authentication key. This can be accomplished by using your authentication key
as the HTTP authentication username and leaving the password blank.

**Example HTTP authentication using an API key**

    curl http://XYZ123456@dydra.com/repositories

Since some HTTP clients require a password when using HTTP authentication, you can use a capital
letter `X` as the password.

**Example HTTP authentication using an API key, with password**

    curl http://XYZ123456:X@dydra.com/repositories

## API Authentication Key as a Query String Parameter

You can also authenticate to the API with your authentication key by passing the key as a query
string parameter named `auth_token` with your request.

**Example authenticating using the authentication key as a query string parameter**

    curl http://dydra.com/repositories?auth_token=XYZ123456

## Standard HTTP Authentication

You can also authenticate to the Dydra API without your API key using your username and password
over standard HTTP authentication.

**Example standard HTTP authentication using account username and password**

    curl http://jhacker:password@dydra.com/repositories
