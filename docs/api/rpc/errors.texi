There are two kinds of error conditions that can be raised by API
operations: client errors and server errors.

@section Client Errors

Client errors indicate that the server found a problem with the request
issued by the client, and therefore declined to process the request. You
should @emph{not} retry the request until the problem has been corrected in
your application.

When using HTTP as the transport, client errors are indicated by a
@code{4xx} HTTP response code.

The following table lists all client error conditions:

@end multitable

@section Server Errors

Server errors indicate a transient problem of some kind within the server.
The request should be retried at a later time.

When using HTTP as the transport, server errors are indicated by a
@code{5xx} HTTP response code.

The following table lists all server error conditions:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .20 .50
@headitem Error @tab {HTTP Code} @tab Description
@item @code{internal-error}
@tab 500
@tab ...
@item @code{service-unavailable}
@tab 503

@end multitable
