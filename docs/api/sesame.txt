Sesame API
==========

Dydra supports a standard [Sesame
API](http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame/users/ch08.html) to help interact with
the data in your repositories.  There are some noteable changes in the Dydra.com
Sesame API implmentation that have been documented below.

### Sesame API URLs

The standard Sesame API URLs can be found at

`http://dydra.com/<your account>/sesame`.  

All of the routes in the Sesame API
include a 'servlets' path which is optional in Dydra's implementation of the 
spec. For example, 

`http://dydra.com/jhacker/sesame/servlets/uploadURL` 

is also accessible at 

`http://dydra.com/jhacker/sesame/uploadURL`.

Additionally, where applicable, repository specific paths have been enabled
to allow direct access to an API method. In these instances, the `repository`
parameter specified in the API is determined from the URL. For example, You
can access the uploadURL method at 

`http://dydra.com/jhacker/foaf/uploadURL`.

### Authentication

The Dydra.com Sesame API does not support logging in ([8.1.1](http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame/users/ch08.html#d0e2533))
or logging out ([8.1.2](http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame/users/ch08.html#d0e2590))
using the standard Sesame API methods. Instead, you will need to authenticate
each of your API requests using your API token or by using your username 
and password via standard HTTP authentication.

### SeRQL

At this time, Dydra does not currently support either of the SeRQL Sesame API
methods. ([8.1.2](http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame/users/ch08.html#section-comm-http-table-queries) 
and [8.1.4](http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame/users/ch08.html#section-comm-http-graph-queries))
