What is RDF?
============

### Overview

The Resource Description Framework, or RDF, is an extremely flexible data model
with numerous serializations and a [powerful query language.](/sparql)  RDF consists of
'graphs' and 'triples'. Each triple comprises a 'subject', a 'predicate', and
an 'object'. Each graph contains a set of triples.

In RDF, every element is either a universally unique URI, a data literal, or
'blank node', whose identity is not known.  This can make it seem verbose, but
it's critically important for machines when reading data from multiple sources.

A good summary is at <http://www.rdfabout.com/quickintro.xpd>, and a good
comparison of modeling a simple piece of knowledge in a wide variety of data
models is at <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/formats>.

The use of URIs allows multiple data sources to talk about the same entities
using the same language.  It's a critical piece of the puzzle for making wildly
different data sets talk to each other.  None other than Tim-Berners Lee, who
invented HTTP and thus the web, has written [a good, short piece on why RDF's
interoperability characteristics are
important](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDF-XML.html).

### Standards

RDF is a W3C standard, the original version of which was completed in 2004.
The W3C maintains a [list of relevant recommendations.](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all)

The original set of W3C standards blessed a particular serialization, RDF/XML,
which we believe was a problem for RDF uptake.  RDF is not a subset of XML, nor
does it need to be as complicated as RDF/XML can be.

### Using It

RDF is a data model, akin to the relational model we know from databases.  Like
relational databases you may be familiar with, the model has numerous competing
implementations, built around a mostly-compatible query language.  For RDF,
this query language is [SPARQL](/sparql).
