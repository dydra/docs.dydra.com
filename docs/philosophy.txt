Our Philosphy
==================

Dydra is a cloud-based RDF platform built on several principles about how we
believe software development should work. Some of them are inspired by companies
around us. Others come from our disappointment with existing
tools for the technologies we love. Together, they're Dydra's goals.

## Developer Productivity is Everything

Developer productivity is paramount. No resource is more valuable.
We never allow two steps when one would do, never have a step where zero
would do, use smart defaults, offer multiple ways to do the same thing.
Development should be fun, and removing busywork makes that happen.

## There Should be no Sysadmin

No part of the platform needs babysitting, monitoring, tweaking, or
interference from you. Every tweak you make is meaningful for your
application's behavior, not the platform's performance. You never have
to allocate resources, figure out ahead of time how big a repository needs to
be, or mess around with equivalent queries that mysteriously run at different
speeds. There is no sysadmin, and good lord, youn need no DBA.

## Be Open

Our product is this platform. An code which is *not actually the platform*, is
is open, and free. Developers have enough problems without enigmatic,
mysterious tooling. Our docs? A git repository, make changes to it. Our SPARQL
dialect? The canonical definition is a set of executable tests. Libraries we
contribute to? Open. Libraries we write? Open. Platform status? If it breaks,
you'll know how, and hear about how it's going to be fixed in the future.

## You Own Your Data

You're not signing your data over to Dydra, Dydra hosts it for you.
License it however you see fit, or delete it from our servers entirely. We
claim no ownership on any of your work.

## Be the Best

If you have any reason to use another RDF platform, we want to know. Whatever the
reason. We're listening to you.
