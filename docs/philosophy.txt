Our Philosphy
==================

Dydra is a cloud-based RDF platform built on several principles about how we
believe tools for software developers should work. Some of them are inspired
by companies around us. Others come from our disappointment with existing
tools for the technologies we love. Together, they're Dydra's goals.

## Developer Productivity is Everything

Developer productivity is paramount. No resource is more valuable. We never
allow two steps when one would do, never have a step where zero would do,
use smart defaults, offer multiple ways to do the same thing. Development
should be fun, and busywork isn't fun.

## There Should be no Sysadmin

No part of the platform needs babysitting, monitoring, tweaking, or
interference from you. Every tweak you make is meaningful for your
application's behavior, not the platform's performance. You never have to
allocate resources, figure out ahead of time how big a repository needs to
be, or mess around with equivalent queries that mysteriously run at
different speeds.

## Be Open

Our product is this platform. Any code we write which is *not actually the
platform*, is open, and free. Developers have enough problems without
enigmatic, mysterious tooling. Our documentation? It's just a Git
repository; go ahead, fork it and improve it. Our SPARQL dialect? The
canonical definition is a set of executable tests. Libraries we contribute
to? Open. Libraries we write? Open. Platform status? If it breaks, you'll
know how, and hear about why it's not going happen in the future.

## You Own Your Data

You're not signing your data over to Dydra, we're just hosting it. License
it however you see fit, or delete it from our servers entirely at any time.
We claim no ownership on any of your work.
